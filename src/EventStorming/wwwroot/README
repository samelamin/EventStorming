Sticky Notes - an HTML5 experiment.
** Targeted for Chrome and Safari **
It works surprisingly well in IE9, although it's not supported or recommended.

This is a project I made to help me learn JavaScript. I wrote as many functions as I thought were reasonable to avoid using heavy JQuery.

Update (1/30/2012):
    Complete engine rewrite
    Better delete handling (drag note to trash icon)
    Added color picker
    Added title to note
    Removed 'sortable' option
    Added Facebook OpenGraph metadata

    Todo:
        GTasks integration
        Star/favorite notes
        Due notifications
        Fix calendar styling
        Make notes resizable
        Fix persistent sidebar tooltips

Note: the file "htaccess" should be named ".htaccess" if deploying.
